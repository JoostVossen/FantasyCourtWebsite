                Fantasy Court is a fantasy festival that is focused on the somewhat unique and niche culture that surrounds fantasy events and LARP. This festival has a vast array of stalls, associations, and activities that all fall under the purview of the awesome world of fantasy. This would entail LARP associations, surprising board games, exotic foods, a LARP sword fighting tournament (with a special children’s division!), storytellers, a LARP archery range, family crest painting as well as a wide variety of stalls that sell anything related. We offer all that belongs in the world of fantasy, and anything that will make you feel part of that world.
                <br>
                Most importantly, everyone is welcome! If you’re a student or not, a parent with children or alone; it does not matter who you are. You will be welcome and you will find something to do. There will be workshops organized, various activities, and the all impressive sword fighting tournament for children and adults!

            <h1>Edition 2019</h1>
            <p>
                The newest edition of Fantasy Court, FantasyCourt 2019, will take place on the 2nd of June 2019 and will be held in the midday and afternoon. It will take place on the campus of the Technical University of Eindhoven (a specific location with route directions will be provided in time).<br>
                The festival itself and participation in the swordfighting tournament will be entirely free. However it should be considered that money will be asked for (some) activities, products in stalls, catering, and other such instances. It is going to be a most promising day full of amazing stories, combat and all around fun.
            </p>

            <h1>How can I participate?</h1>
            <p>
                The festival area is open to everyone and neither a ticket nor a reservation is required to enter. To join the tournament people will have to register (for free). This can be done at the tournament area before the start of the tournament.
            </p>
