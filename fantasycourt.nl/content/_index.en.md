# What is Fantasy Court?
Fantasy Court is a fantasy festival that is focused on the somewhat unique and niche culture that surrounds fantasy events and LARP (Live Action Role Playing). This festival has a vast array of stalls, associations, and activities that all fall under the purview of the awesome world of fantasy. This would entail LARP associations, surprising board games, exotic foods, a LARP sword fighting tournament (with a special children’s division!), storytellers, a LARP archery range as well as a wide variety of stalls that sell anything related. We offer all that belongs in the world of fantasy, and anything that will make you feel part of that world.

Most importantly, everyone is welcome! If you’re a student or not, a parent with children or alone; it does not matter who you are. You will be welcome and you will find something to do. There will be workshops organized, various activities, and the all impressive sword fighting tournament for children and adults!

# Editie 2022 - Open the Gates!
{{< renderImageResource id="fc-2019-archer" path="Boogschieten.png" class="" style="float: right; width: 200px; margin-top: 20px;" >}}
It is finally time for Fantasy Court to take place physically again! On Sunday, June 12th, Fantasy Court is back with a market, a LARP swordfighting tournament, archery, and more, just like in the good old days! To celebrate our return to being an in-person event, we've decided the 2022 theme will be: *Open the Gates!*

This year, we're cooperating with the [LARP Platform](https://www.larp-platform.nl) to create a LARP-corner, where different LARP-organisations group together to host a cosy corner for new people who are interested in LARP and the whole world around it. Furthermore, we have been busy with setting up extra activities, such that there is even more to do throughout the day itself. Keep an eye on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FantasyCourt/), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/fantasycourtnl), and [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/fantasy_nl).

Fantasy Court 2022 takes place on the campus of the Eindhoven University of Technology on *het Koeveld*.

# Edition 2021
Fantasy Court 2021 took place online on this website, where vendors that would have normally attended a physical event each got their own subpage. These subpages consisted of great photos, fun facts about vendors or Fantasy Court itself, and of course the things sold by each vendor. By "walking around" the digital festival, you got to know the answers to the treasure hunt, which would give you a chance to win the last [LARP Xperience box](https://www.larp-platform.nl/merch/xperiencebox-2021/) of the LARP Platform!

*The winner of the treasure was announced through our social media. Congrats Bert Mans!*

## LARP Platform Article 2021
In collaboration with the LARP Platform, we wrote [an article](https://www.larp-platform.nl/informatie/fantasy-court-liefde-voor-larp/) about Fantasy Court! What can you do there? Who is the organisation? Where can we be found? This (and more) is explained in combination with a set of beautiful pictures!

## Video and Article Edition 2019
{{< youtube id="fhyHCuGGCp8" title="Fantasy Court 2019" >}}
The Cursor made a video and wrote an [article](https://www.cursor.tue.nl/en/news/2019/juni/week-1/its-not-the-size-of-the-sword-that-matters-my-boy/) about Fantasy Court 2019. It was pretty warm that day, but nevertheless the day was very successful!

## Edition 2019
The most recent physical edition of Fantasy Court, [Fantasy Court 2019](https://www.facebook.com/events/2583251595022623/), took place on the afternoon of the 2nd of June 2019, on the campus of the Technical University of Eindhoven. In order to ensure success, we ordered an extra serving of good weather. Sadly, we got a bit too much sun, resulting in high temperatures. This wasn't enough to spoil the fun, though, and with an additional layer of suntan, we managed to make it a beautiful event full of amazing stories, brave combat, and all-around fun.

# Previous editions
The festival originally started back in 2016 as the [LarpBattle](https://www.facebook.com/events/564866377026074/), followed by two successful editions of Fantasy Court: [Fantasy Court 2018](https://www.facebook.com/events/121539801858080/) and [Fantasy Court 2017](https://www.facebook.com/events/795289227288793/").
And this year has every intention to even better than the previous ones. So if you want to witness something magical, edition 2020 is not one you want to miss.

# How can I participate?
