        Hi I'm Remy! Did you know that I told many fun facts on the online edition of Fantasy Court in 2021?

Fantasy Court is a small-scale, free Fantasy Festival in Eindhoven that focuses on the culture surrounding fantasy, LARP, and boardgames and tabletop roleplay. Normally it takes place physicially during the summer with fun activities, like a LARP swordfighting training and tournament, archery, and all kinds of neat small vendors on a market selling (LARP) accessories, books, clothing, or food. Furthermore, there are several live acts with music, dance, storytelling, or even a podcast!

The online edition of Fantasy Court 2021 has (onfortunately) ended. If you still ended up on this page, then we would like to invite you to Fantasy Court 2022 instead, which will take physically again like in the good old days!
