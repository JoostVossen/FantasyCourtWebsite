# Event 2021 - Under Construction
Fantasy Court 2021 will be, unlike previous editions, fully online due to the ongoing COVID restrictions. This digital edition is currently under construction and will be available mid-august right here on this page (the exact date is TBA through our social media channels).

The digitial event will feature information on vendors or acts that would have otherwise joined our offline festival. Furthermore, a small treasure hunt is available and completing it gives you a chance to **win a LARP-experience box** we are giving away!
