_Out of sight there is a hidden forest where the flora is alive and fauna their caretaker where each resident has their own story to tell. But some daring inhabitants want to explore the world: each with their own reasons._

_The plum rabbits built a center where the residents can sign up for adoption. When accepting a roommate please note that they need attention and care. Usually the residents apply for adoption during the season they prefer: winter, spring, summer or autumn._

Mamorumori forest residents are completely handmade. Most fabrics used are bought locally. Each resident has a unique name, history and personality. They are one of a kind.

The founder, ZoÃ« Seekles, is a 26 year old Dutch girl that designs and creates Mamorumori residents. Since 2019 she has created this idea of a forest hidden away from humans where flora lives and fauna is their caretaker. She can combine her love and passion for nature, fantasy, storytelling, art, Japan and design into Mamorumori. Since 2021 she is trying to pursue her dream of doing this fulltime. Support her and her small business and find yourself a new roommate to live with! P.S. You do not need to water these plants.
