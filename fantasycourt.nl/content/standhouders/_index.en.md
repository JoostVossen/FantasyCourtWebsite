# Vendors Edition 2022
In order to make Fantasy Court the best version it could be, we'd like to have people who can enrich the experience in whatever way possible. We offer an enthousiastic public looking for ambience and specific affairs, because where else can you find a festival focussed on LARP and LARP-related affairs?!

## Who are we looking for?
We look for people, organisations or businesses that could, for example, offer (one or more of) the following:

Shopping stalls with items, accessories and even costumes for:
* LARP
* Roleplayin Games
* Boardgames

Shopping stalls with other produce that is related to the Fantasy theme such as:
* Juwellery
* Costumes
* Fantasy Game/Film Merchandise
* Fantasy/Science Fiction Books

People who can give workshops in:
* LARP
* Storytelling

Folks who can give demos in:
* Roleplaying Games
* Boardgames
* LARP-scenes or battles

People who can perform acts that can carry away the audience:
* Music
* Dance

A way to fill hungry stomachs:
* Food: Snacks, sandwiches, etc.
* Drinks, Medieval Beverages, etc.

## Practical information
Fantasy Court 2022 will take place around June 2022 on one of the grass fields on the campus of the Technical Univerisity of Eindhoven. Further information on the exact times will be announced later, though we intend to entertain through most of the afternoon till the early evening.

The costs for vendors will consist of a small fee (â‚¬17,50) and the (optionally) additional costs for a market stand or tent that can be rented through us (depending on your request and availability). Market stands and tents are rented directly at cost price of our supplier. Your own stands or tents can also be brought as long as this has been notified to the organisation beforehand (for the sake of the festival layout).

Compensation for performances, acts, or workshops can be negotiated with the organisation.
