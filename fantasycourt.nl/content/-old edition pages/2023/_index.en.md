Apart from the fact that Fantasy Court has more vendors than ever, this year the court's podium is also fuller than ever! Enjoy the sun while while listening to the music or watching dance, take part in workshops, or show everyone your favourite outfit!

### Balfolk Workshop
Do you want to dance during Fantasy Court? Really throw a party? Then this workshop by [Sophie van Grinsven](https://www.facebook.com/sophie.vangrinsven.5) is something for you! Thhis workshop is open to everyone, with or without experience!
Balfolk is a type of dance that consists of a collection of West-European dances. In balfolk both duo as well as group-dances are performed. Originally, these dances were performed on weddings and town parties in different places in Europe. Today, balfolk can be described as an active tradition with all kinds of influences from several other types of music and dance.

### Andawenn
[Andawenn](https://www.facebook.com/Andawenn) plays atmospheric instrumental music originating from Ireland, Scotland and Bretagne. Maaike de Waal plays the Irish flute, transverse flute and whistles. Hans Elzinga plays the Guitar. Nice melodies to listen silently to, and jigs and reels to move with!

### Het Doldwaze Draai Duo
What's better than a hurdy-gurdy? Two hurdy-gurdies of course! The duo will get everyone dancing, or at least moving, with their rhytms.

### Dance Act: The Warrior Within
The dancers from [Fan-tastique](https://www.facebook.com/DancersFantastique), Ilse "Meave", Bonny Boudicca and Desirée join forces with those of [Triskelion](https://www.facebook.com/triskeliondanceandcreativecourses), Sophie van Grinsven, to bring a small ode to those that are fighting their own battle or have done so in the past. Ultimately, there is a warrior with their own battle contained within all of us. The show named "The Warrior Within" will show dance combined with hand fans and other attributes, ending with a fan veil. Afterwards, you can try to it yourself!

### Costume Contest
Are needle and thread just your thing? Do you always have a self-made outfit ready to put on? Then the costume contest is for you! Registration is possible on the day itself at the info-stand. Nice prizes can be won!
