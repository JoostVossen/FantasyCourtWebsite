                Fantasy Court is a fantasy festival that is focused on the somewhat unique and niche culture that surrounds fantasy events and LARP (Live Action Role Playing). This festival has a vast array of stalls, associations, and activities that all fall under the purview of the awesome world of fantasy. This would entail LARP associations, surprising board games, exotic foods, a LARP sword fighting tournament (with a special children’s division!), storytellers, a LARP archery range as well as a wide variety of stalls that sell anything related. We offer all that belongs in the world of fantasy, and anything that will make you feel part of that world.
                <br>
                Most importantly, everyone is welcome! If you’re a student or not, a parent with children or alone; it does not matter who you are. You will be welcome and you will find something to do. There will be workshops organized, various activities, and the all impressive sword fighting tournament for children and adults!

		<h1>Edition 2020, CANCELLED</h1>
        <p>
            With pain in our hearts, we unfortunately needed to cancel Fantasy Court 2020. The current nationwide regulations concerning COVID-19 are in place until (at least) the 1st of June, whilst Fantasy Court 2020 would be on the 7th of June.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is too short to organise a festival without acceptable human risk, financial risk, or study delays. We have considered moving the festival, but cannot find any good options offering enough security for a successful event, good weather, or time until Fantasy Court 2021.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Due to this reason, we have decided to fully focus on the next edition around June 2021. We hope to see you all then in good health.
        </p>

            <h1>Edition 2019</h1>
            <p>
                The most recent edition of Fantasy Court, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2583251595022623/">FantasyCourt 2019</a>, has taken place on the 2nd of June 2019 during the afternoon. It took take place on the campus of the Technical University of Eindhoven. In order to ensure succes we ordered an extra serving of good weather. Sadly we got a bit too much sun resulting into high temparatures. This wasn't enough to spoil the fun though and with an additional layer of suntan we managed to make it a beautiful event full of amazing stories, brave combat and all around fun.
            </p>

            <h1>Previous editions</h1>
            <p>
